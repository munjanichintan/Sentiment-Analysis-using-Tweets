# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Tweets
This project is Sentiment Analysis using Tweets where I am using tweepy for access twitter data or we can say access tweets, followers counts, following counts etc. I am using TextBlob for process text of tweets. Ex. I take Donald Trump's twitter account for sentiment analysis. I will mention username of Trump's twiiter account in output console and we can see output Trump is Positive, Negative or Neutral men.
